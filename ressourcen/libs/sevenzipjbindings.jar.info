		  initialization routine.
		- Detailed JavaDoc

	* Integration test for all platforms for single and multiple platform distributions

Release - 4.65-1.01rc-extr-only (Release candidate, extraction only, cross-platform, based on zip/p7zip 4.65)

	* API change was necessary to fix a bug:
		- net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.prepareOperation(ExtractAskMode) is void now.

		- net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.getStream(int, ExtractAskMode) accepts null return values now.
		  null return values can be used to skip on the fly extraction/testing of archive items. 

	* net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.ISevenZipInArchive.extract(int[], boolean, IArchiveExtractCallback):
		- the first parameter "int[]" is optional now. If null value passed all archive items will be extracted.
		  It if possible to exclude particular items later on using IArchiveExtractCallback call back. Returning null
		  out of net.sf.sevenzipjbinding.IArchiveExtractCallback.getStream method will skip extraction/testing.
